# Authentication and Navigation Troubleshooting Plan

## Phase 1: Route Configuration âœ…
- [x] Verified pre-login navbar setup
- [x] Checked root layout structure
- [x] Fixed import paths for components
- [x] Created Navigation component to handle conditional rendering
- [x] Updated root layout to use Navigation component

## Phase 2: Pre-Login Navigation Flow
### Current Status
- [x] Created unified Navigation component
- [x] Implemented conditional rendering based on auth state
- [x] Set up proper routing for public pages
- [ ] Test login/signup button functionality
- [ ] Verify page transitions and loading states

### To Test
1. Click each navigation item in pre-login navbar
   - Verify correct routes
   - Check for smooth transitions
2. Test login button
   - Should navigate to /login
   - Form should be accessible
3. Test signup button
   - Should navigate to /signup
   - Form should be accessible

## Phase 3: Authentication Process
### Current Status
- [x] Set up Redux store for auth state
- [x] Integrated AuthContext with Redux
- [x] Implemented proper provider order
- [ ] Test login form submission
- [ ] Test signup form submission

### To Test
1. Login Process
   - Form validation
   - API call simulation
   - Success/error notifications
   - Redirect to dashboard
2. Signup Process
   - Form validation
   - Account type selection
   - Success/error handling
   - Redirect flow

## Phase 4: Post-Login Navigation
### Current Status
- [x] Set up AuthNavbar with private routes
- [x] Implemented user menu
- [x] Added logout functionality
- [ ] Test authenticated routes
- [ ] Verify profile menu actions

### To Test
1. Dashboard access
2. Profile menu functionality
3. Logout process
4. Route protection

## Common Issues to Check
1. Provider Order
   - [x] Redux Provider wraps AuthProvider
   - [x] Theme providers in correct order
   - [x] Navigation component within AuthProvider

2. Import Paths
   - [x] Updated all absolute imports to relative
   - [x] Verified component imports
   - [x] Checked for circular dependencies

3. State Management
   - [x] Redux store configuration
   - [x] Auth state persistence
   - [x] Loading states
   - [ ] Error handling

4. Navigation Guards
   - [ ] Protected route handling
   - [ ] Redirect logic
   - [ ] Loading states during auth checks

## Next Steps
1. Test pre-login navigation thoroughly
2. Verify login form functionality
3. Test auth state persistence
4. Check protected route behavior

## Notes
- Created Navigation component for conditional navbar rendering
- Fixed provider ordering in root layout
- Updated import paths to use relative paths
- Integrated Redux for auth state management
