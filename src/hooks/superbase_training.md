Supabase VectorStore Implementation

Supabase's VectorStore provides a robust solution for implementing vector similarity search within Node.js applications. By leveraging the SupabaseVectorStore from the langchain library, developers can easily store and query document embeddings in a Supabase database.

Storing and Querying Vectors

To store vectors, you can use the SupabaseVectorStore.fromTexts method, which takes an array of texts and their corresponding metadata, along with an embeddings generator like OpenAIEmbeddings. Here's a quick example:

import { SupabaseVectorStore } from 'langchain/vectorstores/supabase'
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from 'langchain/embeddings/openai'
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

// Initialize Supabase client
const client = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY)

// Create a VectorStore instance
const vectorStore = await SupabaseVectorStore.fromTexts(
  ['Hello world', 'Bye bye', "What's this?"],
  [{ id: 2 }, { id: 1 }, { id: 3 }],
  new OpenAIEmbeddings(),
  {
    client,
    tableName: 'documents',
    queryName: 'match_documents',
  }
)

// Perform a similarity search
const result = await vectorStore.similaritySearch('Hello world', 1)
console.log(result)
Advanced Metadata Filtering

Supabase also supports advanced metadata filtering using JSONB containment operators. This allows for more granular queries, such as searching for documents with specific metadata values.

Hybrid Search

For more complex search requirements, Supabase supports hybrid search, combining full-text search with vector similarity. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets and diverse search criteria.

Supabase provides a suite of tools for handling authentication in Node.js applications, including endpoints for various auth strategies such as email/password, OAuth, and passwordless OTP. When a user signs up, they are assigned a unique ID, which can be referenced throughout your database.

Implementing Email and Password Authentication

To authenticate users with email and password, use the signInWithPassword method provided by the supabase-js library:

const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js')

const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey)

async function signIn(email, password) {
  const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
    email: email,
    password: password,
  })
  if (error) throw error
  return { user, session }
}
OAuth Authentication

For OAuth authentication, such as signing in with GitHub, use the signInWithOAuth method:

async function signInWithGitHub() {
  const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
    provider: 'github',
  })
  if (error) throw error
  return { user, session }
}
Handling Sign Out

To sign out a user, call the signOut method:

async function signOut() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut()
  if (error) throw error
}
These code snippets demonstrate the basic usage of Supabase's authentication API in a Node.js environment. It's important to handle errors and manage user sessions securely in your application.

Generating TypeScript Types with Supabase CLI

The Supabase CLI streamlines the process of generating TypeScript types for your Supabase project, enhancing your development experience with strong typing and autocompletion features. To begin, ensure you have the CLI installed and are logged in with your Personal Access Token. You can install the CLI using npm with the command npm i supabase@">=1.8.1" --save-dev and log in using npx supabase login.

Once logged in, generate types for your project by running npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id "$PROJECT_REF" --schema public > types/supabase.ts. This command creates a types/supabase.ts file, which you can then import into your TypeScript files, such as src/index.ts, to leverage the types for your database tables.

For example, in a Next.js API route, you can use the generated types with the Supabase client as follows:

import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
import { Database } from '../types/supabase'

const supabase = createClient<Database>(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY
)

// Your API logic here
This setup provides enhanced type safety and autocompletion, making it easier to work with your Supabase data. Remember to regenerate your types whenever your database schema changes to keep the types up-to-date.

Supabase Storage and File Management

Supabase provides a robust storage solution for managing files and assets within your applications. Utilizing the supabase-js SDK, developers can easily upload files to a specified bucket. For files not exceeding 6MB, the standard upload method is recommended, which employs multipart/form-data for transmission.

Uploading Small Files

import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabase = createClient('your_project_url', 'your_supabase_api_key')

async function uploadFile(file) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.storage.from('bucket_name').upload('file_path', file)
  if (error) {
    console.error('Upload error', error)
  } else {
    console.log('File uploaded', data)
  }
}
For larger files, the TUS Resumable Upload protocol is advised to ensure reliability and efficiency during the upload process.

Overwriting Existing Files

To overwrite a file, set the upsert option to true. However, it's generally better to upload to a new path to avoid CDN propagation delays.

Setting Content Types

By default, the content type is inferred from the file extension. You can explicitly set the content type using the contentType option during upload.

Restricting Uploads

When creating a bucket, you can specify allowedMimeTypes and maxFileSize to restrict uploads. Non-compliant files will be rejected, ensuring that only the desired file types and sizes are stored.

Supabase's storage solution is integrated into every project, allowing for the management of large files such as images and videos. With the ability to create buckets with specific configurations, developers can maintain control over the types and sizes of files uploaded, ensuring that storage remains optimized for their application's needs.
