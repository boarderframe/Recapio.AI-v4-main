# Development Tracker

## How We Work Together

### Planning Approach
1. **AI Assistant Role**
   - Maintain detailed plans to ensure consistency
   - Track dependencies and potential impacts
   - Proactively identify related changes
   - Provide structured recommendations

2. **Developer Role**
   - Drive high-level direction
   - Make key architectural decisions
   - Approve or modify suggestions
   - Set priorities and focus areas

3. **Collaboration Rules**
   - Plans stay in `/plans/active/` for AI reference
   - Keep `DEVELOPMENT.md` as our shared quick reference
   - AI handles detail tracking, developer focuses on building
   - Regular check-ins on progress and direction

4. **Communication**
   - AI will reference specific files/components
   - Developer can use natural language for intent
   - Both maintain context through the tracker
   - Flexibility to adjust plans as needed
